Known issues

In the current version of mantis client, there is this issue: If an RPC request involving the “latest block” is underway at the exact same time a new block is imported, the request may fail. It may cause errors to pop up in the wallet either during sync process or during fetching transaction history. Those errors do not limit functionality of the wallet. The RPC request can be retried.
